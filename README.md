**DataCleaning.R**	is the main script for cleaning and merging data sets

**CityCleaning.R** is a scrip to clean the cities in the GTD, which has a lot of inconsistentcies and typos

**CountryCleaning.R**	is a scrip to bring the GTD country coding to Wold Bank / UN standarts for country coding and erases all historic codings (East Germany, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia...)


**Anything else** are temporary scripts to be included into DataCleaning.R at a later point


note: the only R related projects working with the GTD have been found here
