**DataCleaning.R**	is the main script for cleaning and merging data sets. The result is the "preGTD" saved as csv in the Terror Data Folder.

**CityCleaning.R** is a script to clean the cities in the GTD, which has a lot of inconsistentcies and typos.

**CountryCleaning.R**	is a script to bring the GTD country coding to World Bank / UN standards for country coding and erases all historic codings (East Germany, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia...).
.

**Anything else** are temporary scripts to be included into DataCleaning.R at a later point.


note: the only R related projects working with the GTD have been found here
