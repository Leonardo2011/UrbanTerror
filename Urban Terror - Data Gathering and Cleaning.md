Ok guys, here is a short suggestion on how to structure the write up:

1. Short Introduction
2. Types of Data used, what they contain and what columns overlap 
    2.1. Qualitative Data on Terrorist Attacks
    2.2. Geolocated City-Data
    2.3. Country-Level Data
3. Where we got all the data
4. Challenges in all the Data Sets
    4.1. Missing Information
    4.2. Inconsistencies
    4.3. Untidy Data
5. How we cleaned each dat set and make them comparable
6. How we merged them and what we have now
7. What we still have to do before we can go into the deep analysis
8. Nice to haves for analysis
9. What we can already say with the data set we have
10. Examples of what we can say (tables, figures)
