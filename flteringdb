#The Global Terror Database (GTD) we are using for our analysis contains over a 100k observations on more than 120 variables. 
#The complete database contains redundant (because it is also stored in the codebook) or dispensable (because we do not need it for our
#analysis) information. We therefore filter the database to make it fit our needs. We erase over a 100 variables. Also, we only want to look
#at successfull terror attacks and the ones that happened after 1989.
