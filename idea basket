Things to clean the city vector in the gtd

1. Al-something and al-soemthing and al something and al-'something should both be alsomething 

Buenas Aires = buenos aires,
Buenos Aiers = buenos aires,
Buenos Aires = buenos aires,
Buenos Aires (La Tablada) = buenos aires,
Buenos Aires (Olivos) = buenos aires, 
Buenos Aires (Pacheco Sector) = buenos aires, 
Buenos Aires Province = buenos aires, 
Buenos Aries = buenos aires, 
San Juan City = san juan 
San Salvador de Jujuy = jujuy
Cochabamba City = cochabamba
LaPaz = la paz


Thats how I got rid of (something), [something], all spaces, all :"<>)@*#^ in another dataset:
UrbanCenters$City <- gsub("\\[.+?\\]","", UrbanCenters$City)
UrbanCenters$City <- gsub("\\(.+?\\)","", UrbanCenters$City)
UrbanCenters$City <- gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", UrbanCenters$City)
UrbanCenters$City <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", UrbanCenters$City)
UrbanCenters$City <- tolower(UrbanCenters$City)
GTD$city <- sub("^ +", "", GTD$city)
GTD$city <- sub(" +$", "", GTD$city)
GTD$city <- gsub(" ", "", GTD$city)
GTD$city <- substr(GTD$city, 1, 8)

NA = (blank), blank, unknown, Unknown, not stated
remove: Airfield, Air Fields, district, International Airport, Airport, 




controlling: putting them in one after the other and then combine them finally, but carefull with taht: 
mind covariaten if using other things then urbanization, like GDP or something
