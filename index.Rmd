## Intro

The world is in flames, political violence concerns us all. Why does it occur? How to  respond?

David Kilcullen, an influencal counterinsurgency expert published his new book  called *Out of the Mountains. The Coming Age of the Urban Guerilla* [@Kilcullen2013]. He describes political violence as something that used to occur in small villages far from big cities and urban life. And he predicts that this was about to change. In the future, political violence will happen in the completely opposite space: In big cities that are highly connected with each other, crowded and often close to the coastline. That is the space of future conflict. 



<p style='text-align: center;'>*Where does political violence happen?*</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'>*Is it moving to the urban, connected, crowded, littoral space?*</p>
  
  


We know that people historically have always preferred to live at the coastal, and that there is a global urbanization - people moving to the cities rather than living in villages. But Kilcullen goes further. He suggests that political violence is migrating towards the urban, crowded, connected, and littoral space faster than people are. We wanted to find out whether that may be true.

Have a look at our interactive map. What you see are bubbles that stand for cities in the Middle East: The size stands for the number of inhabitants, the color for the victims of terrorist from 1990-2003.

And now the same for 2004 until the end of our dataset in 2013. Bagdad changed the scale with over 51.000 victims dramatically. Why? May would argue that the Iraq War changed the region. After the war ended, several groups started to conduct attacks, around the beginning of 2004, with a focus on capital. But there are other changes everywhere.

## What We look at

We conduct a statistical analysis to see if over the past years, acts of political violence were in fact more likely to happen in urban environments, or it is just that people are moving to these places. For this, we gather data from a lot of different sources:
Our main dataset is the Global Terrorism Database, a huge dataset that contains over 120,000 violent attacks since 1970 [@START2013].
Additionally, we want to know a lot about the environment in which these attacks take place. This information is not included in the GTD. So we have gathered a lot of information on cities in all countries of the world. Some come from the World Bank, some even from Wikipedia, but all our source include:

 * Global night light eminations capured by satelites
 * Distance of ever place in the world to the coastline 
 * Travel distance to the next bigger city
 * The type of landcover around
 * Population density
 * Economic activity
 * And of course the change over time for all these 

If you have ever worked with data yourself, you probably know that the most of the time you spend with it is on making it fit your needs: Finding, gathering,  cleaning, tidying, calculating, merging. All of our datasets have a lot of missing information and we needed a lot of work to align things like city and country names and find all the missing values of information.

## An example of how its done

We have taken a couple of attacks from the GTD that happend in Turkey just to show  what we are doing. Here is a little description of each of them and what happened there:


* 2003-11-14, Istanbul: Two car bombings by the militant Islamic group, Great East Islamic Raiders Front (IBDA-C - Islami Buyuk Dogu Akincilar Cephesi), on synagogues in Istanbul, Turkey, killed at least twenty people and injured 302 others. One of the two almost simultaneous blasts occurred at the Beth Israel Synagogue, damaging the building and several cars. Numerous people were reportedly killed and injured in the bombing. The group identified itself in a telephone call to the Anadolu News Agency.

 * 2008-07-27, Istanbul: On Sunday, two bombs exploded minutes apart in one of Istanbul's busy shopping districts on the European side. Though the Kurdistan Workers Party denied responsibility for the attack, officials continually accuse them of direct involvement.
 
 * 1999-07-30, Gurpinar: A total of four village guards were killed in Gurpinar, Turkey, when a group of perpetrators attacked the guards who were protecting the Telekom employees. Officials reported that the employees where the target of this attack.
 
 * 1999-03-05, Cankiri: A car bomb attack targeted the Cankiri Provincial Governor, Ayhan Cevik, while he was driving in Cankiri, Turkey. Four people were killed and the Governor and nine others were wounded. The Turkish Workers and Peasants Liberation Army (TKP/ML-TIKKO) claimed responsibility for the attack.
 
 * 2003-08-01, Ankara: An unnamed leftist organization detonated an explosive device in the garden of the Justice Ministry's Center of Education for Judge and Prosecutor Candidates in Ankara, Turkey. Eleven people, including policemen and judges, were injured in the explosion. Although a group claimed responsibility for the attack, Turkey's Interior Minister, Abdulkadir Aksu, did not publicly reveal the perpetrator group's name.
 
 * 1998-11-27, Kirikkale: A bomb exploded on a bus near Kirikkale, Turkey. The explosion killed four passengers and injured 20 others. The bomb was placed in the luggage department of the bus. There was no claim of responsibility for this attack.

 * 1999-10-18, Bademli: Unknown perpetrators set a Greek citizen's house on fire in the village of Bademli on Gokceada island, Turkey. A small child died in the fire.
 
 * 1998-09-09, Kuyucak: In one of two related attacks, rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) attacked the Imamli settlement unit in the village of Kuyucak, Turkey, killing one person and injuring three (Mustafa, Hilmi and Nuriye Atici). The perpetrators fled after this incident.
 
 * 2006-08-28, Antalya: Four people were killed and approximately 65 were injured when a bomb attached to a motorcycle detonated in Antalya, Turkey. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.

 * 2006-08-28, Antalya: A car filled with explosives exploded 80 meters from the Russian Consulate General in Antalya, Turkey, killing three people and wounding at least 20 more. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities believed the Kurdish separatists were to blame.
 
 
 
To illustrate a little bit better what we are actually doing behind the fancy calculations, have a look at all these maps. They are examples of how we gather additional information on the 130.000 incidents of political violence in the global database.

This shows you how much light communities emenate at night - a sign for people with afordable electricity.

Now we know something more about these places. We gather this data for all 130.000 incidents in the Global Terrorism Database. But there is much more, like travel distance to the next biggest city, in minutes that would need to be traveled.

## Analysis and Results

After we used all the information we collected, arranged them in a certain way (you can get some impression from looking at the maps above), we feed all of this data into a statistical model. The outcome is this regression table, which tells us, how much our independent variables (like urbanisation) influence the dependent variables (the target violent extrimist chose to carry out an attack).

So what do we see here? A little bit surprisingly, the outcome of our analysis is quite the oppsite of David Kilcullen's predictions. In fact, violent extremists do not attack urban places more frequently than they grow anyway. Quite the opposite.



<p style='text-align: Center;'>**That was just the beginning of our analysis!**</p>

We hoped you like this website, and we would be happy to hear from you. Feel free to send us a message, ask us for more regression tables and our data if you like!
