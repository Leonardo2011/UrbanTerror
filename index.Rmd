# Intro

At the latest since 9/11, terrorism - acts of political violence - concerns us all. Researchers across the world have analyzed political violence from a lot of angles:
  * Why does terrorism occur?
  * What is unique about some attacks?
  * Is something similar with attacks?
  * How do we fight terrorism?
  
We are interested in two related questions:

  * Where does political violence happen?
  * Does terrorism change?
  
David Kilcullen, an Australian counterinsurgency expert has published book in 2013 called *Out of the Mountains. The Coming Age of the Urban Guerilla* [@Kilcullen2013]. He describes political violence as something that used to occur in small villages far from big cities and urban life. Small, landlocked, Rural communities. And he predicts that this was about to change. In the future, Kilcullen says, Political Violence will happen in the completely opposite space: In big cities that are highly connected with each other and probably close to the coastline. Political violence, Kilcullen says, will move to the urban, connected, crowded, litoral space. 


At a first glance, this actually does not seem to surprising: We know that people historically have always preferred to live in coastal space, and that there is a global trend towards urbanization - people moving to the cities rather than living in villages.

But Kilcullen goes farther: What he suggests is not only that as populations move, terrorists move with them, but that terrorists will move to these place even faster than the rest of the population. Terrorists were a kind of "Vanguard" being in urban environments even quicker than everybody else.

We wanted to find out whether that may be true.

# An Example

Take a look at the map above, it illustrates acts of political violence before 2004 - why 2004? We are sure you remember the Iraq War. After the war ended, several groups started to conduct attacks (around the beginning of 2004). If you check the map above, you see a map of attacks happening in the middle east before the insurgency in Iraq. Farther below, you can compare that with a map of political violence in Iraq since 2004 (we end our dataset in 2013)


# What We look at


We conduct a statistical analysis to see if over the past years, acts of political violence were in fact more likely to happen in urban environments than people moving to these places. For this, we gather data from a lot of different sources:
Our main dataset is the Global Terrorism Database, a huge dataset that contains over 120,000 violent attacks since 1970.
Additionally, we want to know a lot about the environment in which these attacks take place. Alas, this information is not included in the GTD. So we have gathered a lot of information on cities in all countries of the world. They come from the World Bank, Wikipedia, and other open source information and include things like:

 * Global nightly light eminations
 * Distance of all communities of the world from the coastline
 * Population density across the world
 * Economic activity
 * The travel time from each place of the world to the next bigger city
 
 
If you have ever worked with data yourself, you probably know that the most of the time you spend with it is on making it fit your needs: Cleaning, Tidying, Calculating. All of our datasets have a lot of missing information and we needed a lot of work to align things like city and country names and find all the missing values of information.

# A Little Visualization

We have taken a couple of attacks from the GTD that happend in Turkey (just to show you what we are doing, there is no particular reason why Turkey). Here is a little description of each of them and what happened there:


* 2003-11-14, Istanbul: Two car bombings by the militant Islamic group, Great East Islamic Raiders Front (IBDA-C - Islami Buyuk Dogu Akincilar Cephesi), on synagogues in Istanbul, Turkey, killed at least twenty people and injured 302 others. One of the two almost simultaneous blasts occurred at the Beth Israel Synagogue, damaging the building and several cars. Numerous people were reportedly killed and injured in the bombing. The group identified itself in a telephone call to the Anadolu News Agency.

 * 2008-07-27, Istanbul: On Sunday, two bombs exploded minutes apart in one of Istanbul's busy shopping districts on the European side. Though the Kurdistan Workers Party denied responsibility for the attack, officials continually accuse them of direct involvement.
 
 * 1999-07-30, Gurpinar: A total of four village guards were killed in Gurpinar, Turkey, when a group of perpetrators attacked the guards who were protecting the Telekom employees. Officials reported that the employees where the target of this attack.
 
 * 1999-03-05, Cankiri: A car bomb attack targeted the Cankiri Provincial Governor, Ayhan Cevik, while he was driving in Cankiri, Turkey. Four people were killed and the Governor and nine others were wounded. The Turkish Workers and Peasants Liberation Army (TKP/ML-TIKKO) claimed responsibility for the attack.
 
 * 2003-08-01, Ankara: An unnamed leftist organization detonated an explosive device in the garden of the Justice Ministry's Center of Education for Judge and Prosecutor Candidates in Ankara, Turkey. Eleven people, including policemen and judges, were injured in the explosion. Although a group claimed responsibility for the attack, Turkey's Interior Minister, Abdulkadir Aksu, did not publicly reveal the perpetrator group's name.
 
 * 1998-11-27, Kirikkale: A bomb exploded on a bus near Kirikkale, Turkey. The explosion killed four passengers and injured 20 others. The bomb was placed in the luggage department of the bus. There was no claim of responsibility for this attack.

 * 1999-10-18, Bademli: Unknown perpetrators set a Greek citizen's house on fire in the village of Bademli on Gokceada island, Turkey. A small child died in the fire.
 
 * 1998-09-09, Kuyucak: In one of two related attacks, rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) attacked the Imamli settlement unit in the village of Kuyucak, Turkey, killing one person and injuring three (Mustafa, Hilmi and Nuriye Atici). The perpetrators fled after this incident.
 
 * 2006-08-28, Antalya: Four people were killed and approximately 65 were injured when a bomb attached to a motorcycle detonated in Antalya, Turkey. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.

 * 2006-08-28, Antalya: A car filled with explosives exploded 80 meters from the Russian Consulate General in Antalya, Turkey, killing three people and wounding at least 20 more. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities believed the Kurdish separatists were to blame.
 
 
To illustrate a little bit better what we are actually doing behind the fancy calculations, have a look at all these maps, where you can see examples of what we analyze and also show you where the attacks the GTD described above happened:

This map shows you how much light communities in Turkey emenate at night - which is a sign for how many people live there:

Here you can see how long people need to get from where they live to the next biggest city:

This shows you how far away from the coast communities are:

And finally, population density:

# Analysis and Results

After we used all the information we collected, arranged them in a certain way (you can get some impression from looking at the maps above), we feed all of this data into a statistical model. The outcome is this regression table, which tells us, how much our Independent Variables (the change in some population data over time) influence the Dependent Variables (the target environment attackers chose)
